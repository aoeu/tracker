# TODO(anybody): 

## `view.go`

- Padding for cells - always be a padded width of the maxmimum size per number (use tabwriter?)
- "Expand" and draw some kind of placeholder values that get used when a track is shorter than others.
- What's the input mechanism to trigger a screen-wide redraw?
- Draw a border around an entire pattern?
- Add view for a pattern table itself.
- Do not export Width and Height on View
- Make accessor methods to read View height and width from other packages.
